<h1>Groovifier</h1>

This project is the public repository version of my final project for my Computer Graphics course.

<h2>How to run</h2>
<ol>
  <li>You can download the source code and then run the downloaded folder in VS Code, and then run "python -m http.server" to run the project locally</li>
  <li>Else, the project is also available at this link: https://mk39-png.github.io/Groovifier/ </li>
</ol>

<h2>Known issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Also, the visualizer for the inner and outer ring meshes appear to be unaffected by the inputted audio in the web app version. Otherwise, the project is fine when ran locally.</li>
</ul>
